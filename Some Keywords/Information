1. Check
Just like If but here we can only check whether the test/condition is true of False
If true, it will not print anything
If false, it will says command is failed indicating the Test is False

2. Select
Just like Switch in C language
This will allow one of the alternatives or test to check and run its associated action
Since ABC does not have else, this can be good method to write alternative conditions and their associated different actions.
Here, it will check whether the condition/test is true or not, once true it will perform the action and will not go ahead.

3. AND
Just like and in Python
It will make the conditions linked to And to be checked.
If both of them is true, then only the action will be performed
Its use is if,for,while statements

4. OR
Another Logic used in real world that can be interpreted in a programming language.
It will allow us to check the conditions.
It will see that if one or more than one conditions are true then we can perform the action
