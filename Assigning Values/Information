The Keyword PUT is responsible for assigning the value of a variable.

Here we announce the "value" first or expr said in official documentation and variable later in the statement or address in official documentation.

But the Keyword IN is same in both languages and have the same functionality.

We can add a list,numerical,string,compound and telephone list value to a assigning varible.

We can check that by printing that variable by using "WRITE" Keyword.
