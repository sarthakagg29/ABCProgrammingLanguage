Just like Python, ABC has an if statement that can help us check a condition is true or false.

But here there is following "ELSE" if the condition is false and we wanted to do an action for else condition.

In the code , <> is not equal sign in ABC which is different from != in Python. 

The Implementation is same just the operator signs are different.

We can see the indentations are used in order to seperate the block of code and to execute it properly.
