We can input a value into a variable by using READ command

READ address EG expr

Here at address, we write the variable
Here at expr, we write the expr that is data type we like to input

There are some examples in the code and Read can take all types of data 
There are errors coming in order to fully understand the meaning of Read Command mostly entering a Compound Data type.
And how the elements need to be alike.
